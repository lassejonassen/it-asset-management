# IT Asset Management System
This project was built by me to be presented at my final exam for my AP CS degree.

The project includes serveral backend .NET Web Apis and exposes data to an Angular frontend application. The project was not fully finished, as the purpose of the project was to experiement with different technologies. Prior to building the project I worked very little with docker. The project also introduced me to Kubernetes.
